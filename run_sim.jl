# POLICY SHOCK SECTION
# ========================
# Note: it is typically easiest to introduce shocks to period-view variables 
#       and then convert them to cohort-view variables using per2coh()

## tax shocks
#tauprof = tauprof*0+0.15                    # profit tax rate is set to 15%
#tauprof[10:tend] = tauprof[10:tend]*0+0.15  # profit tax rate is set to 15%, starting in 10 years (announced today)
#tauprof[1:10] = tauprof[1:10]*0+0.15        # profit tax rate is set to 15% temporarily for next 10 years
#tauWv = tauWv*1.02; tauWz = per2coh(tauWv)  # wage tax is increased by 2%

## delayed retirement (uncomment whole block)
#rag[1:10] = seq(rag0,rag0+2,10); rag[11:tend].=rag0+2 
#notretv[:,:] .= 0
#for tt in 1:tend
#  notretv[1:floor(Int,rag[tt]),tt] .= 1
#  notretv[floor(Int,rag[tt])+1,tt] = rag[tt]-floor(rag[tt])
#end
#notretz = per2coh(notretv)                  # effective retirement age is increased linearly by 2 years over the next 10 years
 
## pension cut
#pv = pv*0.95; pz = per2coh(pv) # pensions are cut by 5%

## productivity shocks
#thetav = thetav*1.02; thetaz = per2coh(thetav)                       # individual productivity increases permanently by 2%
#thetav[:,1:30] = thetav[:,1:30]*1.02; thetaz = per2coh(thetav)       # individual productivity increases by 2% in the next 30 years
#TFP = TFP*1.02                                                       # total factor productivity increases permanently by 2%

## fertility shocks
#NB = NB*1.02             # 2% more newborns every year
NB[1:30] = NB[1:30]*1.02 # 2% more newborns every year over next 50 years

## mortality shocks
gamv[60:nag,:] = 1.0.-(1.0.-gamv[60:nag,:])*0.9; gamv[nag,:].=0; gamz = per2coh(gamv)  # reduction of old-age mortality by 10%

## shock to the initial capital stock
#K[1] = K0*0.99                                                       # 1% of capital stock is lost in first period

## change in targeted debt path
#DG[5:20] = seq(DG0,DG0*0.9,20-5+1); DG[21:tend] = DG0*0.9 # reduce public debt by 10% over 15 years starting in 5 years
